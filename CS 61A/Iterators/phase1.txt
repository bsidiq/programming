Q: What is the significance of an Insect's health attribute? Does this
value change? If so, how?
Choose the number of the correct choice:
0) It represents the strength of an insect against attacks, which
   doesn't change throughout the game
1) It represents the amount of health the insect has left, so the
   insect is eliminated when it reaches 0
2) It represents health protecting the insect, so the insect can only
   be damaged when its health reaches 0
? 2
